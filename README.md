# WeatherData

This code is for pulling historical weather data from open-meteo.com

To start, I am pulling the following data for Des Moines, IA from 2000-01-01 to 2024-07-06
- data
- max_temp
- max_temp_units (F)
- min_temp
- min_temp_units (F)
- avg_temp
- avg_temp_units (F)

The goals are to:
1) Load the data into AWS
2) Set up a schedule to load new data (frequency yet to be determined)
3) utilize a tool to visualize the data

More to come...
